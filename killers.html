If there's not anything nearby the survivor is thrown with no damage taken.

The first tier Myers stays in Undetectable Status to be able to stalk his survivors' but is slow. Within the second tier Myers is similar to regular killers in speed and attack range. In the third tier Myers is instantly able to down survivors with a hit and increased terror radius and reduced vault time. He is best used with his add ons that allow him to get to the third tier faster and or allow him to instantly win(kill) survivors. </p>

Survivors in the bear trap can be instantly downed or picked up by the trapper. The trapper can also reset the bear traps if they are disarmed.

When Main Event is active The Trickster automatically throws unlimited Blades for the duration of The Main Event with significant increased throw rate and movement speed. </p>

Victor is able to move at great speeds, see pools of blood left by survivors bright red, and can search survivors in lockers and trap them for a limited period of time. When controlling Victor, you are able to pounce on survivors and will latch onto survivors for a small period of time.
